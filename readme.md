# Caviar: A Soda Dungeon 2 MOD

Welcome to Caviar, a Soda Dungeon 2 MOD that contains only the finer things in life.

> **Note:** Caviar was built by me for me, but you demanded it, so here it is.

> **Note:** See the [remarks](#remarks) section regarding support.

# Features

Caviar has many features that will improve your quality of life while playing Soda Dungeon 2. 

Just ask yourself:

- Do you like gold? Well how about a gold per hour heads-up display! 
- Do you like using Stein and question if it is working? We've got you covered. 
- Tired of clicking over, and over, and over, leveling up that gold relic? Well, now you can bring it to the **MAX** with a single click of the mouse! 
- Are you tired of scrolling to see your script triggers? Guess what, now you can see all of those glorious triggers (up to 7) together in a single screen!

# Instructions

Installing and uninstalling Caviar is super easy. Just follow the instructions below and you'll be fine...

## Installing

Installing Caviar is as easy as counting to 3.

> **Note:** Caviar is versioned the same as the game's version. To find the correct version, on the game title screen click the version number at the bottom to get the build number. This number is the version of Caviar to download.

> **Note:** If you do not see a version that matches your current game version, then that means I am either not supporting that version, or I have not gotten around to updating Caviar.

> **Note:** The latest release will only be the live version of the game, beta releases can be found in the 'More Releases' section.

1) Find the version of Caviar that you need (check version number of game; see note above)
   - Download the `Assembly-CSharp.dll` file from the releases section
     > **Note:** Make sure the downloaded file name is exactly `Assembly-CSharp.dll`
2) Find your Soda Dungeon 2 installation folder
   - This is typically found here: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Soda Dungeon 2\SodaDungeon2_Data\Managed`
3) Copy the downloaded dll (`Assembly-CSharp.dll`) into the directory from step 2 overwriting the existing file

## Uninstalling

Uninstalling Caviar is super simple.

1) Open Steam
2) Find Soda Dungeon 2 in your massive game list
3) Right-click Soda Dungeon 2 and click `Properties`
4) Click `Local Files`
5) Click `Verify integrity of game files...`
6) Follow the prompts

# Known Issues

## Adventure UI

- The EPH/GPH display is shown when it shouldn't (v1.1.1; fixed in 1.2.0)
- The CPH display is shown when you have 0 credits earned (v1.2.0)

# FAQ

You've got questions? Well I have answers.

### Q. I want th-

I don't care what you want. The answer is no.

### Q. I want features from MOD X in MOD Y, can I ha-

I said no.

### Q. Why 'Caviar'?

Caviar is considered one of the finer things in life. It's also what the 'cavi' in 'caviyacht' stands for, so... yeah.

### Q. The game isn't loading anymore, what do I do?

More than likely this is caused by the downloaded dll having the incorrect name. Make sure that when you download the dll, it is named `Assembly-CSharp.dll`.

> **Note:** If you have downloaded the mod before, there is a chance that it will end up named `Assembly-CSharp (1).dll` upon downloading it again, if the previous file was still there.

# Remarks

I take no responsibility for anything you do. Always make a backup of the original dll and your save data before using the Caviar MOD, or any MOD.

> **Note:** If the mod does not work for some reason, it's you; not me (check the FAQ for potential support).

A big thanks to Shawn for creating this game.
