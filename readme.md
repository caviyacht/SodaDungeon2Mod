# Caviar: A Soda Dungeon 2 MOD

Welcome to Caviar, a Soda Dungeon 2 MOD that contains only the finer things in life.

To get started, checkout the [wiki](https://github.com/caviyacht/SodaDungeon2Mod/wiki) for information regarding installation and features.

> ℹ️ See the [remarks](#remarks) section regarding support.

## Versions

There are two versions of Caviar: `Live` and `Beta`. The `Live` version will be the latest release shown in the releases section, while the `Beta` version will be marked as a preview release and can be found in the [releases](https://github.com/caviyacht/SodaDungeon2Mod/releases) page.

> ℹ️ If there is a current beta going on, the Live version will not be updated during that time.

- Current Live Version: [Caviar-113.6](https://github.com/caviyacht/SodaDungeon2Mod/releases/tag/v1.2.0b113-6)
- Current Beta Version: n/a

> ℹ️ Caviar's versioning is based on the game's build number (not the game's version).
>
> To find the game's build number, click the version number on the game's title screen (it's at the bottom). This is the version of Caviar to download.
>
> Example: The latest build of v1.1.1 is b106, so Caviar-106.x is the version to download.

## Remarks

I take no responsibility for anything you do. Always make a backup of the original dll and your save data before using Caviar, or any mod.

> ℹ️ If the mod does not work for some reason, it's you; not me. Check the [FAQ](#faq) for potential support.
>
> As always, remember to read the [instructions](../../wiki/Instructions).
